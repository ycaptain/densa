## Significance

While generative AI has been shown to enhance productivity, its
influence on learning new skills remains unclear. Our research
examines the impact of generative AI, specifically GPT-4, on
student learning in math education. Through a large-scale field
experiment in a high school, our study reveals that although
AI-based tutoring improves performance during practice sessions,
students relying on the technology may underperform when access
to AI is subsequently removed, indicating reduced skill
acquisition. However, we also find that carefully designed
safeguards, especially asking the AI tutor to provide
teacher-designed hints instead of giving away answers, can
mitigate these negative effects. Our findings highlight the need
for thoughtful integration of generative AI in educational
settings to ensure that human learning is preserved.

## Abstract

Generative AI is poised to revolutionize how humans work, and has
already demonstrated promise in significantly improving human
productivity. A key question is how generative AI affects
learning—namely, how humans acquire new skills as they perform
tasks. Learning is critical to long-term productivity, especially
since generative AI is fallible and users must check its outputs.
We study this question via a field experiment where we provide
nearly a thousand high school math students with access to
generative AI tutors. To understand the differential impact of
tool design on learning, we deploy two generative AI tutors: one
that mimics a standard ChatGPT interface ("GPT Base") and one with
prompts designed to safeguard learning ("GPT Tutor"). Consistent
with prior work, our results show that having GPT-4 access while
solving problems significantly improves performance (48%
improvement in grades for GPT Base and 127% for GPT Tutor).
However, we additionally find that when access is subsequently
taken away, students actually perform worse than those who never
had access (17% reduction in grades for GPT Base)—i.e., unfettered
access to GPT-4 can harm educational outcomes. These negative
learning effects are largely mitigated by the safeguards in GPT
Tutor. Without guardrails, students attempt to use GPT-4 as a
"crutch" during practice problem sessions, and subsequently
perform worse on their own. Thus, decision-makers must be cautious
about design choices underlying generative AI deployments to
preserve skill learning and long-term productivity.

## Introduction

Generative AI, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, has rapidly emerged as a
disruptive technology capable of achieving human-level performance
on a broad range of tasks (1–5). In many applications, they are
expected to augment humans to help them perform tasks effectively
and efficiently (6). Recent studies have sought to better
understand how humans work in collaboration with these tools
(7–9). Broadly speaking, these studies have focused on
productivity, finding that workers can perform knowledge-intensive
tasks significantly more efficiently when given access to
generative AI.

A key question that remains is how generative AI affects how
humans learn novel skills, both in educational settings and
through the course of performing their jobs. This process of skill
acquisition is critical for safeguarding long-term productivity
(10). However, many generative AI deployments are designed to
automate tasks without consideration for impact on learning. When
technology automates a task, humans can miss out on valuable
experience, inducing a tradeoff where the technology improves
performance on average but introduces new failure cases due to
reduced human skill. For example, overreliance on autopilot led
the Federal Aviation Administration to recommend that pilots
minimize their use of this technology (11); their precautionary
guidance ensures that pilots have the necessary skills to maintain
safety in situations where autopilot fails to function correctly.
The potential for generative AI to interfere with learning is
especially concerning due to the inconsistent reliability of this
technology; for instance, while generative AI has demonstrated
tremendous capabilities such as strong performance on medical
exams (2) and competitive programming (3), it continues to suffer
from hallucinations where it provides confident but factually
incorrect responses (12). As a consequence, users must vigilantly
check its outputs and fix any issues present; if they fail to
learn the underlying skills, then they may lack the expertise
required to do so.

Simultaneously, there has also been interest in leveraging
generative AI to improve learning (13, 14), e.g., by incorporating
it into existing chatbots for personalized tutoring (15, 16).
Given the broad capabilities of generative AI for natural language
understanding of tasks (1), the hope is that generative AI tutors
can automatically identify concepts that students misunderstand
based on their attempts at solving practice problems, and provide
hints to help clarify these misunderstandings so they can make
progress. As a consequence, there is a critical need for field
evidence to help understand whether generative AI can aid or
impede learning. Based on mixed findings from prior deployments of
technologies such as laptops (17) and iPads (18) in educational
settings, we naturally expect learning outcomes to depend
critically on the specific design of the generative AI tool being
deployed as well as the deployment context (19). One of the key
design decisions is the choice of prompt, which is a set of
instructions for how the tool should respond to user queries.
While standard prompts ask the tool to assist the user without
regard for impact on learning, they can be augmented with
guardrails designed to facilitate learning.

In this paper, we study how the design of generative AI tools
affects learning in an educational setting. In collaboration with
a high school in Turkey, we conducted a large-scale randomized
controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the impact of GPT-4 based tutors
on student learning. Specifically, focusing on mathematics, we
study the impact of GPT-4 based tutors on in-class study sessions
designed to help students review material previously covered in
the course. Each study session proceeds in two phases. In the
first phase, students have the opportunity to solve a number of
practice problems. In this phase, students are given access to
standard resources (their course notes and the course textbook),
as well as additional generative AI resources determined based on
a randomly assigned arm; the arms are as follows: i) access to a
standard chat interface based on GPT-4, designed to mimic the
widely used ChatGPT tool (called **GPT Base**), ii) access to a
specialized chat interface built on GPT-4 using guardrails
designed based on teacher input (called **GPT Tutor**), and iii)
no access to generative AI resources. In the second phase,
students must complete an exam on their own without access to any
resources.

Our main results are two-fold. First, students in the GPT Tutor
(resp., GPT Base) arm perform **127% (resp., 48%) better** on the
practice problems compared to students in the control arm. This
finding is consistent with prior work on the benefits of
generative AI on improving human abilities on a variety of tasks.
Second, on the exam, students in the GPT Base arm perform
**statistically significantly worse than students in the control
arm by 17%**; this negative effect is essentially eradicated in
the GPT Tutor arm, though we still do not observe a positive
effect. These results suggest that while access to generative AI
can improve performance, it can substantially inhibit learning
without appropriate guardrails. Importantly, the detrimental
impact of GPT Base on learning is of immediate concern since the
similar ChatGPT tool is already widely used by students outside of
class for help with assignments. Furthermore, an analysis of
student interactions shows that students often use GPT Base as a
"crutch" by asking for and copying solutions, but they use GPT
Tutor in more substantive ways like asking for help or
independently attempting answers. Finally, we find evidence that
students do not perceive any reduction in their learning or
subsequent performance as a consequence of copying solutions,
suggesting they are not aware of how generative AI can impede
their learning. Our results have significant implications for
generative AI tools—while such tools have the potential to improve
human performance, they must be deployed with appropriate
guardrails when learning is important.

## Experimental Design

We created a custom math tutoring program based on OpenAI's GPT-4
(1); our tutor is designed to help students solve a series of
practice problems provided by the teachers (described below). Our
tool has two variants. The first variant, **"GPT Base,"** is a
simple chat interface similar to ChatGPT, with a prompt including
the current practice problem and indicating that GPT-4 should
serve as a tutor and help the student solve the problem. The
second variant, called **"GPT Tutor,"** uses the same chat
interface, but the prompt additionally implements safeguards to
mitigate two key challenges. First, the prompt instructs GPT-4 to
provide hints to the student without directly giving them the
answer, to encourage learning (20). Second, the prompt provides a
significant amount of problem-specific information provided by
teachers, including one or more (correct) solutions to the
practice problem, as well as common student mistakes and how to
provide feedback. This problem-specific construction is
labor-intensive, but ensures that GPT-4 does not provide incorrect
feedback to the student. Fig. 1 shows representative prompts for
both variants; additional details on our tool as well as example
interactions are in *SI Appendix*, Appendix A.1. Note that
students do not see our system prompts in either variant of our
tool.

> 11th grade practice problem in the first session. (See SI
> Appendix Appendix A.1 for full prompt text.)

We performed an RCT to evaluate the impact of this tutoring
program on student performance. The study took place at a large
high school in Turkey during the Fall semester of the 2023–2024
academic year. This study was approved by the University of
Pennsylvania IRB (#853745) and was deemed exempt under 45 CFR
46.104, category 1. We conducted four 90-min sessions for about
fifty 9th, 10th, and 11th-grade classes, comprising **nearly
1,000 students**. For each grade, our sessions collectively
comprised about 15% of the math curriculum covered during the
semester. Each session has three contiguous parts:

1. In the first part, teachers review a topic (e.g.,
   combinatorics) previously covered in the course, and solve one
   or more examples on the board. This part is identical to a
   standard high school lecture.
2. The second part is an **assisted practice period**, where
   students solve exercises designed by teachers to reinforce the
   concepts covered. Our randomized intervention (detailed below)
   only affects this second, self-study part. After students
   submit their answers, the teacher briefly reviews the correct
   answers with the entire class.
3. The third part is an **unassisted evaluation**, where students
   take a closed-book, closed-laptop exam. Importantly, each
   problem in the exam corresponds to a conceptually very similar
   practice problem from the previous part—this design was chosen
   to help students practice the key concepts needed to perform
   well on the exam.

The first and third parts are identical across all treatment arms.
Teachers did not interact with students during the second and
third parts, and all students submitted both practice and exam
answers on paper to maintain consistency across arms. Furthermore,
to ensure incentive compatibility, performance on both the second
and third parts contributed to students' final grades. Details on
the session material and experimental protocol are provided in
*SI Appendix*, Appendix A.

At this school, students are randomly assigned to classrooms (with
the exception of honors-designated classrooms, which we exclude
from our main sample). We assigned each classroom to one of three
treatment arms—control, GPT Base, and GPT Tutor. The control arm
is business-as-usual, having students work through the practice
problems with access to course books and notes with no devices
provided. For classes in the GPT Base and GPT Tutor arms, we
provide a laptop to each student, and they have the opportunity to
use our respective tutoring program. A teacher and a staff member
were present in each experimental class session to ensure that
students did not use other applications or websites during the
session. Students in the GPT arms were also shown a short
instructional video introducing our tool and illustrating prompts
designed to aid learning. Students are free to move between
different problems during the session.

The study has three avenues of data collection. First, at the
start of the semester, we sent out a 10-min survey to students,
collecting data on their demographics and educational background.
We report balance of these covariates across arms in *SI
Appendix*, Appendix A.4. Second, we collected performance data
from both the assisted practice problems and the unassisted exams.
We hired independent graders to evaluate student performance to
reduce potential teacher bias (e.g., self-fulfilling prophecy),
and ensured that each grader was assigned a similar number of
papers across all three arms in each grade–session pair to reduce
potential grader bias. Graders evaluated the scores based on a
teacher-designed rubric; see details in *SI Appendix*, Appendix
A.5. At the end of each session, we surveyed the students on
their experience and preferences. Third, in the GPT Base and GPT
Tutor arms, we collected all student messages and corresponding
GPT-4 responses from interactions with our tutoring program.

**We preregistered this RCT** with a designated primary analysis
of comparing students' unassisted exam outcomes across arms—this
translates to our main findings that generative AI without
guardrails can harm learning.

## Main Results

Our primary regression specification evaluates student performance
in the assisted practice problems and unassisted exam,
respectively:

```
Outcome_{ics}(j) = β1·GPTBase_c + β2·GPTTutor_c + β3·PrevGPA_i
                 + θ_s + δ_g + α_y + λ_t + ε_{ics}    (1)
```

Here, `Outcome_{ics}(j) ∈ [0,1]` is the normalized grade of
student `i` in classroom `c` and session `s ∈ {1,..,4}` for the
assisted (`j=0`) or unassisted (`j=1`) portion; `GPTBase_c` and
`GPTTutor_c` are binary variables indicating treatment assignments
for class `c`; `PrevGPA_i` controls for student performance, and
captures student `i`'s normalized GPA from the previous year; and
`θ_s, δ_g, α_y, λ_t` are session, grader, grade level, and
teacher fixed effects, respectively. SEs are clustered at the
classroom level (which is the unit of randomization). Our main
sample excludes students in honors-designated classrooms (which
are not populated randomly, unlike regular classrooms).

Table 1 reports intention-to-treat estimates from this regression.
We find that GPT Base and GPT Tutor substantially increased
student scores in the GPT-assisted practice sessions by 0.137 and
0.361 (out of 1), respectively, relative to the control arm that
only had access to textbooks (mean performance of 0.28). These
results imply that GPT Base and GPT Tutor would increase
performance on the assisted practice sessions by **48% and 127%**,
respectively, on average relative to the control arm. These
results are consistent with the existing literature on the
productivity effects of generative AI (7, 8). Furthermore, the gap
between GPT Tutor and GPT Base illustrates the added benefits of
problem-specific teacher inputs in the prompt. Specifically, GPT
Base often provides incorrect answers due to hallucinations; in
contrast, the prompt for GPT Tutor includes the solution along
with recommended hints, which enables students to both obtain
useful hints and check their answers once they have them. Our
mechanism analysis in the next section provides a more detailed
analysis supporting this hypothesis.

in the practice (assisted) and exam (unassisted) problems across
grades and sessions; fixed effects are suppressed.

| Adjusted R²                   | 0.382         | 0.379           |

Robust SEs are clustered at the classroom level. HC1 robust SEs
clustered by class. * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01.

In stark contrast, in the subsequent unassisted exam, student
performance in the GPT Base arm degraded by 0.054 (out of 1)
relative to that of the control arm. In other words, **GPT Base
diminished the average control student's performance on the
unassisted exam by 17%**. Student performance in the GPT Tutor arm
was statistically indistinguishable from that of the control arm,
and the point estimate was smaller by an order of magnitude
(-0.004). The fact that students in the GPT Tutor arm performed
similarly to students in the control arm on the unassisted exam
may be surprising since they performed so much better on the
practice problems. This difference may be partly explained by the
fact that students with access to GPT Tutor during the practice
session could ask it to check their answers, whereas students in
the control arm were only shown the solutions after they had
already submitted their answers.

We preregistered a simplistic variation of our main specification
in Eq. (1) using pairwise *t*-tests; the results are reported in
*SI Appendix*, Appendix A.6, and are qualitatively similar.

These results demonstrate an inherent tradeoff in access to
generative AI tools: While these tools can substantially improve
human performance when access is available, they can also degrade
human learning (particularly when appropriate safeguards are
absent), which may have a long-term impact on human performance.

### Problem-Level Specification.

We also examine an alternative regression specification that
examines problem-level outcomes rather than student-level outcomes:

```
Outcome_{icps}(j) = β1·GPTBase_c + β2·GPTTutor_c + β3·PrevGPA_i
                  + θ_s + δ_g + α_y + λ_t + ε_{ics}    (2)
```

Here, `Outcome_{icps}(j) ∈ [0,1]` is the normalized grade of
student `i` in classroom `c` for problem `p` and session `s ∈
{1,..,4}` for the assisted (`j=0`) or unassisted (`j=1`)
portions. *SI Appendix*, Table B.6 reports the results, which are
very similar to the previous student-level specification. The
problem-level specification is useful in the next section, where
we examine how the error rate in solutions generated by GPT Base
in the assisted problems affects student performance and learning
in the subsequent unassisted exam.

### Student Perception.

Interestingly, students' own self-reported perceptions of the
effects of GPT tutors on their exam performance and learning are
overly optimistic. While students in the GPT Base arm performed
worse on the exam (relative to the control arm), they did not
perceive that they performed worse or learned less. Similarly,
while students in the GPT Tutor arm did not perform better on the
exam (relative to the control arm), they perceived that they
performed significantly better. This mismatch between perceived
and actual learning has been observed in other settings (20, 21).
Additional details are in *SI Appendix*, Appendix B.3.

### Heterogeneity.

We look for heterogeneous treatment effects as a function of
preregistered variables, capturing students' ability, resources,
and effort. In general, we find limited to no statistically
significant support for heterogeneous treatment effects with
either treatment, particularly with respect to unassisted exam
performance. Additional details are in *SI Appendix*, Appendix
B.4.

### Grade Dispersion.

We examine a measure of dispersion in student performance—the
Herfindahl–Hirschman index (HHI). Both GPT Base and GPT Tutor
reduced grade dispersion in the assisted practice sessions,
matching prior findings that generative AI assistance reduces the
"skill gap" by providing the largest benefits for the weakest
students (7–9). However, we find no significant effect on HHI for
the unassisted exam—i.e., **the reduction in the skill gap does
not persist when access to AI is removed**. Additional details
are in *SI Appendix*, Appendix B.5.

### Robustness Checks.

Five class sessions did not use the assigned treatment due to
external circumstances (e.g., laptops did not arrive on time). Our
primary specifications use an intention-to-treat analysis—i.e.,
to preserve randomization, we consider all students in a
treatment arm as treated, regardless of whether they actually
received that treatment. In *SI Appendix*, Appendix B.1, we
provide details on noncompliance and perform a regression omitting
noncompliers, finding the same insights. Next, we examine several
variations to our main specification in Eq. (1) to assess the
robustness of our results. These results provide qualitatively
similar insights as our main analysis; see *SI Appendix*, Appendix
B.2. Last, we check whether differential student absenteeism may
impact our results, and find no differential attrition in student
attendance across arms or sessions; see *SI Appendix*, Appendix
B.6.

## Potential Mechanism: Asking for Solutions

In general, students may be adversely affected by GPT Base's
assistance in two ways: 1) errors made by GPT Base mislead
students in the subsequent unassisted problems, or 2) using GPT
Base as a **"crutch"** prevents them from fully engaging with or
understanding the material prior to attempting the unassisted
problems. Recall that the design of GPT Tutor avoids both of
these issues: 1) it rarely makes mistakes since its prompt
includes the solution, and 2) it is hard for students to use it
as a crutch since its prompt asks it to avoid giving them the
answer and instead guide them in a step-by-step fashion (*SI
Appendix*, Fig. A.3). We perform two analyses that help determine
which explanation is more likely. First, we analyze how the error
rate of GPT Base on a practice problem affects students'
subsequent performance on a highly similar exam problem, and
second, we analyze student engagement with the tool. Our findings
suggest that **the second explanation (i.e., students using GPT
Base as a crutch) is the main mechanism** by which GPT Base
impedes student learning.

### GPT Errors vs. Student Performance.

GPT Base often makes mistakes on math problems (22). We first
quantify error rates by repeatedly querying GPT Base using the
most common message used by students in the GPT Base arm—i.e.,
"What is the answer?" For each of the 57 total practice problems,
we ask GPT Base for the answer ten times (resetting the system
between queries), and then manually categorize any errors in the
response as arithmetic (steps followed were correct, but the
resulting computation was incorrect) or logical (steps followed
were partially or fully incorrect). We find that **GPT Base gives
a correct answer only 51% of the time on average**; it makes
**logical errors 42%** of the time and **arithmetic errors 8%**
of the time. Fig. 2 shows the histogram of how often GPT Base
returns an incorrect answer for different problems, demonstrating
significant problem-specific heterogeneity in error rates.
Details are in *SI Appendix*, Appendix C.1.

> Figure 2. Fraction of times GPT Base returns an incorrect answer
> due to a logical (Left) or arithmetic (Right) error for 57
> practice problems across grades and sessions. (Note that GPT
> Tutor does not return an answer by design, and is further given
> the correct answer in the prompt.)

We now assess how errors made by GPT Base affect student
performance on both the practice problems and the unassisted
exam. To this end, we add interaction terms between the error
rate of GPT Base and the treatment arm to the problem-level
regression specification in Eq. (2). When assessing exam
performance, we leverage our paired design of the session
material—i.e., for each exam problem, the teachers included a
conceptually similar practice problem to help students learn how
to solve that exam problem. Thus, for a given exam problem, we
use GPT Base's error rate on the corresponding practice problem.
The regression specification is given in *SI Appendix*, Eq. S5,
and the results are shown in Table 2. Both types of GPT Base
errors negatively impact practice problem performance for students
in the GPT Base arm (i.e., the coefficients of "GPT Base × Logical
Error Rate" and "GPT Base × Arithmetic Error Rate" are
statistically significantly negative in the practice performance
regression).

**Table 2.** Regression results on student performance in the
practice and corresponding exam problems across grades and
sessions; this regression is at the problem level, and includes
interaction terms for the logical and arithmetic error rates of
GPT Base on practice problems (*SI Appendix*, Eq. S5).

We use a correspondence between the exam and practice problems to
estimate how errors on practice problems affect performance on
exam problems. Fixed effects are suppressed. HC1 robust SEs
clustered by class. * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01.

Two key observations support our hypothesis that **students are
using GPT Base as a crutch**:

1. **First**, if students are being misled by logical errors made
   by GPT Base, we would expect these errors to affect performance
   on the corresponding exam problems in the unassisted exam.
   However, while GPT Base's logical errors affect performance on
   the practice problems, we find no evidence that this effect
   spills over to the corresponding exam problems (i.e., "GPT Base
   × Logical Error Rate" does not have a statistically significant
   effect on exam performance). An analogous regression on the
   total error rate (combining both logical and arithmetic errors)
   yields similar insights (*SI Appendix*, Table C.14).
2. **Second**, if students were reading and understanding the
   solutions provided by GPT Base in the practice session, we
   might expect arithmetic errors to have a smaller impact on
   practice problem performance than logical errors. This is
   because students know arithmetic relatively well, and should be
   better able to catch these errors. However, arithmetic and
   logical errors appear to have similar effects on practice
   performance (i.e., "GPT Base × Logical Error Rate" and "GPT
   Base × Arithmetic Error Rate" have similar coefficients in the
   practice performance regression).

Both these results suggest that students are simply copying
answers from GPT Base.

### Student Engagement.

Next, we analyze the messages that students sent to GPT Base or
GPT Tutor to better understand how they are interacting with
these tools. Fig. 3A shows the average number of messages each
student had with their respective GPT tool (Base or Tutor) in a
given session. As can be seen, **the number of messages in GPT
Tutor is significantly higher, and further increases with
experience** using the tool. The fact that students interact
substantially less with GPT Base is consistent with our
hypothesis that GPT Base simply provides students with solutions.

> Figure 3. Student engagement, given by (A) average number of
> student messages per problem, and (B) average fraction of
> student session conversations that have no superficial messages
> (simply restating the question or asking for the answer) per
> session, by treatment (GPT Base and GPT Tutor) over time.

For a more fine-grained understanding of the content of the
student messages, we use natural language processing and
clustering to group student messages (see *SI Appendix*, Appendix
C.2 for details). We manually associate each cluster with a text
description summarizing the content of the messages in that
cluster. As shown in *SI Appendix*, Fig. C.4, students in GPT Base
most often simply ask for the answer; in contrast, students in
GPT Tutor learn to interact more substantively with the tutoring
tool over time by asking for help and independently attempting to
solve the problem.

We observe this learning effect even within the first session—if
we restrict to the very first interaction students have with our
tool in the first session, **56% in the GPT Base arm** and **42%
in the GPT Tutor arm** either repeat the question text or ask for
the answer; in contrast, when considering the first interaction
across all problems in the first session, this number **increases
to 67% for GPT Base but decreases to 37% for GPT Tutor**.

We consider clusters where the student simply asks for the answer
(specifically, "Repeat Question Text" and "Ask for Answers") to
be **superficial**, and the remaining clusters (specifically,
"Attempted Answers" and "Ask for Help") to be **nonsuperficial**.
For a given student in a given session, we consider the
corresponding conversation superficial if the student asked any
superficial messages, and nonsuperficial otherwise. Intuitively,
nonsuperficial conversations are ones where the student
constructively interacts with the tutoring tool and never asks
for the answer. Fig. 3B shows the aggregate rate of nonsuperficial
conversations for both GPT Base and GPT Tutor. As can be seen,
across all sessions, in the GPT Base arm, only a small fraction
of conversations are nonsuperficial; in contrast, a substantially
larger fraction of conversations in the GPT Tutor arm were
nonsuperficial. These results suggest that the vast majority of
students are using GPT Base to obtain solutions, whereas a
significant fraction of students are using GPT Tutor in a purely
substantive way.

## Discussion

Our results provide a cautionary tale regarding both the existing
use of the freely available ChatGPT tool by students as well as
the potential deployment of GPT-based tutors in educational
settings. While generative AI tools such as ChatGPT can make
tasks significantly easier for humans, they come with the risk of
deteriorating our ability to effectively learn some of the skills
required to solve these tasks. These shortcomings have been
anecdotally reported for tools such as Khanmigo (23), a GPT-4
based tutoring application. Our findings support both the need
for educators to find ways to safeguard student learning in the
face of freely available tools such as ChatGPT as well as the
need to design more effective guardrails for generative AI
tutors.

In some ways, ChatGPT is not the first technology to exhibit this
tradeoff—for instance, typing diminishes the need for
handwriting, and calculators diminish the need for arithmetic,
etc. However, we believe ChatGPT differs from prior technologies
in two significant ways. First, the capabilities of ChatGPT are
substantially broader and more intellectual compared to prior
examples; for instance, our experiments focus on a broad variety
of mathematical topics, which encompass fundamental skills
required by a wide range of knowledge-intensive professions.
Second, unlike many prior technologies, ChatGPT is highly
unreliable and often provides incorrect responses. Our results
suggest that students are either unable to detect these failures
or unwilling to spend the effort needed to check correctness.

While the guardrails implemented in GPT Tutor appear to largely
mitigate these negative effects, substantial work is required to
enable generative AI to positively enhance rather than diminish
education. **GPT Tutor remains passive**, responding to students
when they ask questions but failing to proactively engage students
with the material. Effective human tutors ask probing questions
to uncover student misconceptions, and then clarify these
misconceptions by providing tailored explanations. Combining
existing software tutors (15, 24) with generative AI may be a
promising path to achieving this goal, since it balances the
pedagogical principles baked into existing algorithms with the
capability of generative AI to understand and respond to complex
student queries. One way to do so is to leverage agent approaches
(25, 26), which compose models with different prompts to achieve
complex goals; for instance, we might use one prompt to ask the
model to identify student misconceptions, and then use another
prompt to ask it to generate a useful hint. Beyond designing
better tutors, promising avenues include educating students and
teachers about how to more effectively use generative AI, and
leveraging generative AI to help teachers instead of focusing on
students (13). For instance, recent evidence suggests that
**"co-pilots"** that work with a human tutor instead of replacing
them might be a more promising path toward effective use of
generative AI in education (27).

Finally, while our study takes a step toward understanding the
potential harms of generative AI on learning, it focuses on a
specific deployment context, and substantial work is needed to
better understand the nature and scope of these effects. First,
our study focuses on two generative AI tutors for a single topic
(mathematics) deployed in a single high school in Turkey. We have
objective evaluation criteria for math problems, which is
unavailable in other important subjects such as writing. Our
deployment was also carried out in **Fall 2023**, when generative
AI was still very new; modes of interaction may have changed now
that users are more familiar with effective uses of these tools
and their shortcomings. Furthermore, both closed and open-weight
models have significantly improved in performance since then.
Additional studies are required to assess generalizability to
other tutor designs and deployment contexts. Moreover, **we focus
on short-term outcomes due to limitations imposed by our partner
school; studying long-term outcomes is a key direction for future
research**. Last, while we have performed several analyses to
uncover mechanisms underlying our findings, our approach can be
complemented with controlled experiments in settings where more
fine-grained interventions and monitoring are possible to better
understand these mechanisms.
