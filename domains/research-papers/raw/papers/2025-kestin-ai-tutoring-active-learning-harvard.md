## Abstract

Advances in generative artificial intelligence show great potential
for improving education. Yet little is known about how this new
technology should be used and how effective it can be compared to
current best practices. Here we report a randomized, controlled
trial measuring college students' learning and their perceptions
when content is presented through an AI-powered tutor compared with
an active learning class. The novel design of the custom AI tutor
is informed by the same pedagogical best practices as employed in
the in-class lessons. We find that students learn significantly
more in less time when using the AI tutor, compared with the
in-class active learning. They also feel more engaged and more
motivated. These findings offer empirical evidence for the efficacy
of a widely accessible AI-powered pedagogy in significantly
enhancing learning outcomes, presenting a compelling case for its
broad adoption in learning environments.

## Introduction

With their human-like conversational style and knowledge drawn
from extremely large data sets, generative artificial intelligence
(GAI) chatbots have inspired visions of expert tutors available on
demand through every smartphone [1]. The President of the United
States, at the time of this investigation in 2023, pledged to
"shape AI's potential to transform education by creating resources
to support educators deploying AI-enabled educational tools, such
as personalized tutoring in schools." [1] Despite this recent
excitement, previous studies show mixed results on the
effectiveness of learning, even with the most advanced AI models
[2, 3]. While these models can answer technical questions, their
unguided use lets students complete assignments without engaging
in critical thinking. After all, AI chatbots are generally
designed to be helpful, not to promote learning. They are not
trained to follow pedagogical best practices (e.g., facilitating
active learning, managing **cognitive load** [4], and promoting a
**growth mindset**). Another well-known flaw of AI tutors is their
uncanny confidence when giving an incorrect answer or when marking
a correct reply as incorrect [5]. As reported here, a carefully
designed AI tutoring system, using the best current GAI technology
and deployed appropriately, can not only overcome these challenges
but also address significant known pedagogical challenges in an
accessible way that can offer world-class education to any
community or learning environment with an internet connection.

Although passive lectures are among the least effective modes of
instruction, they remain in wide use in science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses [6, 7, 8]. Passive
lectures have several long-known issues: (1) They move too
quickly for some students and too slowly for others because the
teacher controls the pace of instruction; (2) Students do not
receive personalized feedback to their questions as they arise;
and (3) They fail to maintain consistent student engagement.
**Active learning** pedagogies, such as peer instruction,
small-group activities, or a flipped classroom structure, have
demonstrated significant improvements over passive lectures
[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. However, any approach that involves one
teacher working with many students will suffer, at least in part,
from the same three problems that plague passive lectures.

Working with an expert personal tutor is generally regarded as the
most efficient form of education [15]. A tutor can guide the
student while providing personalized feedback and answering
questions as they arise. Expert tutors will adapt their approach
to a student's individual ability, pace, and specific needs. They
offer a more focused and efficient learning experience, managing
the student's cognitive load. In addition, personalized
instruction can foster a growth mindset, which has been shown to
promote students' persistence in the face of difficulties [16, 17].
While the advantages of personalized instruction are clear, this
model of education cannot scale to meet the needs of a large
number of students [15].

What if an AI tutor could mimic the learning experience one would
get from an expert (human) tutor? It could address the unique
needs of each individual through timely feedback while adopting
what is known from the science of how students learn best. This is
the focus of our work. Through a design that involves targeted,
content-rich prompt engineering, we developed an online tutor that
uses GAI and best practices from pedagogy and educational
psychology to promote learning in undergraduate science education.
We conducted a randomized controlled experiment in a large
undergraduate physics course (**N = 194**) at Harvard University,
with a student population broadly representative of those found
across a range of institutions, to measure the difference between
(1) how much students learn and (2) students' perceptions of the
learning experience when identical material is presented through
an AI tutor compared with an active learning classroom.

## Results

In this study, students were divided into two groups, each
experiencing two lessons, each with distinct teaching
methodologies, in consecutive weeks. During the first week, group 1
engaged with an AI-supported lesson at home while group 2
participated in an active learning lesson in class. The conditions
were reversed the following week. To establish baseline knowledge,
students from both groups completed a pre-test prior to each
lesson, focusing on **surface tension** in the first week and
**fluid flow** in the second. Following each lesson, students
completed post-tests to measure content mastery and answered four
questions aimed at gauging their learning experience, including
engagement, enjoyment, motivation, and growth mindset.

### Learning gains: post-test scores

Learning gains were measured by comparing the post-test scores of
the AI group and the in-class active learning group to the
pre-test scores of the two groups combined. Students in the AI
group exhibited a higher median (M) post-score (**M = 4.5,
N = 142**) compared to those in the in-class active learning group
(**M = 3.5, N = 174**). The median learning gains for students,
relative to the pre-test baseline (M = 2.75, N = 316), in the
AI-tutored group were over double those for students in the
in-class active learning group. We conducted a two-sample rank-sum
(Mann–Whitney) test to compare the distribution of post-scores of
the two groups. The analysis revealed a statistically significant
difference (**z = −5.6, p < 10⁻⁸**). Figure 1 shows mean
aggregate results (weeks 1 and 2 combined) of the learning gains
for the group taught with in-class active learning compared to the
group taught with the AI tutor.

### Time on task

During a 75-minute period, the in-class students spent 15 minutes
taking the pre- and post-tests; we assume 60 minutes spent on
learning. For students in the AI group, we tracked their use of
the AI tutor platform to measure how long they spent on the
material, the distribution for which is shown in Figure 2. **70%
of students in the AI group spent less than 60 minutes on task,
while 30% spent more than 60 minutes on task. The median time on
task for students in the AI group was 49 minutes.**

> Figure 2. AI tutor time on task: Total time students in the AI
> group spent interacting with the tutor. Dotted line denotes the
> length of the in-class active learning lesson (60 minutes).

### Learning gains: linear regression model

We constructed a linear regression model (Table S1) to better
understand how the type of instruction (in-class active learning
versus AI tutor) contributed to students' mastery of the subject
matter as measured by their post-test scores. This model includes
the following sets of controls:

- **First**, we controlled for background measures of physics
  proficiency: specific content knowledge (pre-test score),
  broader proficiency in the course material (midterm exam before
  the study), and prior conceptual understanding of physics
  (Force Concept Inventory or FCI) [18].
- **Second**, we controlled for students' prior experience with
  ChatGPT.
- **Third**, we controlled for factors inherent to the crossover
  study design: the class topic (surface tension vs fluids) and
  the version of the pre/post tests (A vs B).
- **Finally**, we controlled for time on task.

Given that our experiment is a crossover design in which each
student experiences both conditions, this model clusters at the
student level.

Table S1 shows that, controlling for all these factors, the
students in the AI group performed substantially better on the
post-test compared with those in the in-class active learning
group. We show this to be a highly significant (**p < 10⁻⁸**)
result with a large effect size. While the linear regression
suggests an **effect size of 0.63**, this is an underestimation
due to ceiling effect; a quantile regression allows us to provide
an estimate of the effect size that avoids ceiling effect in the
post-test scores. Such an analysis provides an **effect size in
the range of 0.73 to 1.3 standard deviations**.

Notably, **there was no correlation between the time on task and
students' post-test scores**, despite quite a wide range of times
measured for the AI group (Figure 2). As discussed further below,
students' ability to pace themselves with the AI tutor is an
advantage of personalized instruction compared with in-class
learning.

### AI tutor: students' perceptions of learning

Figure 3 shows students' average level of agreement with four
statements about their perceptions of learning, broken down
between the two groups (in-class active learning vs. AI tutor).
Students rated their level of agreement on a 5-point Likert scale,
with 1 representing "strongly disagree" and 5 representing
"strongly agree."

- In responding to the first statement, relating to
  **engagement**, the students in the AI group agreed more
  strongly (Mean = 4.1, SD = 0.98) than those in the in-class
  active learning group (Mean = 3.6, SD = 0.92), **t(311) = −4.5,
  p < 0.0001**.
- Likewise, in responding to the second statement, relating to
  **motivation**, students in the AI group agreed more strongly
  (Mean = 3.4, SD = 1.0) than those in the in-class active
  learning group (Mean = 3.1, SD = 0.86), **t(311) = −3.4,
  p < 0.001**.
- Students' average level of agreement with the remaining two
  statements (relating to **enjoyment** and **growth mindset**)
  were not statistically significantly different between the two
  groups.

To summarize, Figure 3 shows that, on average, students in the AI
group felt significantly more engaged and more motivated during
the AI class session than the students in the in-class active
learning group, and the degree to which both groups enjoyed the
lesson and reported a growth mindset was comparable.

## Discussion

We have found that when students interact with our AI tutor, at
home, on their own, they **learn significantly more than when they
engage with the same content during an in-class active learning
lesson, while spending less time on task**. This finding
underscores the transformative potential of AI tutors in authentic
educational settings. In order to realize this potential for
improving STEM outcomes, student-AI interactions must be carefully
designed to follow research-based best practices.

The extensive pedagogical literature supports a set of best
practices that foster students' learning, applicable to both human
instructors and digital learning platforms. Key practices include:

i. facilitating active learning [11, 19],
ii. managing cognitive load [4],
iii. promoting a growth mindset [15, 16],
iv. scaffolding content [20],
v. ensuring accuracy of information and feedback,
vi. delivering such feedback and information in a targeted and
    timely fashion [21], and
vii. allowing for self-pacing [22].

We aimed to design an AI system that conforms to these practices to
the fullest extent current technology allows, thus establishing a
model for future educational AI applications.

### Designing successful student-AI interactions

A subset of the best practices (i–iii) were incorporated into the
AI pedagogy by careful engineering of the **AI tutor's system
prompt**. We designed the AI tutor with a system prompt with
guidelines (Supplementary Material 1) to facilitate active
engagement, manage cognitive load, and promote a growth mindset.
However, we found that a system prompt could not reliably provide
enough structure to scaffold problems with multiple parts (iv), as
the AI tutor would occasionally discuss parts out of sequence or
that were not immediately relevant. For this reason, the AI
platform was designed to **guide students sequentially through each
part of each problem in the lesson, mirroring the approach taken by
the instructor during the in-class active learning** (see
screenshot of AI tutor platform in Figure S1).

The occurrence of inaccurate "hallucinations" by the current
generation of large language models (LLMs) poses a significant
challenge for their use in education [23]. Thus, we avoided relying
solely on GPT-4 to generate solutions for these activities. Given
that LLMs proceed by next-token prediction, accuracy in complex
math or science problems is enhanced when the system generates, or
is provided with, **detailed step-by-step solutions** [24].
Therefore, we enriched our prompts with comprehensive, step-by-step
answers, guiding the AI tutor to deliver accurate and high-quality
explanations (v) to students. As a result, **83% of students
reported that the AI tutor's explanations were as good as, or
better than, those from human instructors** in the class.

While best practices (i–v) can be readily adhered to in a classroom
setting, the remaining best practices (vi–vii) cannot. Providing
timely feedback that targets the specific needs of individual
students (vi) and self-pacing (vii) are difficult to achieve and
impossible to maintain in a typical classroom. **We believe that
the increased learning from structured AI tutoring is largely due
to its ability to offer personalized feedback on demand**—just as
one-on-one tutoring from a (human) expert is superior to classroom
instruction [15]. In addition, interactions with the AI tutor are
self-paced (vii), as indicated by the distribution of times in
Figure 2. Students who need more time to build conceptual
understanding or to fill gaps in their knowledge can take that
time, instead of having to synchronously follow the pace of the
in-class lesson. Students who are familiar with the material or
have underlying skills, however, can move through the activities
in less time than required for the in-class lesson. We measured
the students' perception of pace during the control condition
(in-class active learning) on the days the experiment took place.
Notably, the 3.8% of students who found the pace of class "too
fast" all spent more than the median time (49 minutes) on the AI
lesson, while the 2.2% who found the pace of the in-class lesson
"too slow" all spent less than the median time on the AI lesson.

Our results contrast with previous studies that have shown
limitations of AI-powered instruction. Krupp et al. (2023)
observed limited reflection among students using ChatGPT without
guidance [25], while Forero (2023) reported a decline in student
performance when AI interactions lacked structure and did not
encourage critical thinking [2]. **These previous approaches did
not adhere to the same research-based best practices that informed
our approach.** Our success suggests that thoughtful implementation
of AI-based tutoring could lead to significant improvements to
current pedagogy and enhanced learning gains for a broad range of
subjects in a format that is accessible in any environment with an
internet connection.

### Implications for personal AI tutors in education

How might an AI tutoring system, such as the one we have deployed,
integrate into current pedagogical best practices, given its
effectiveness in terms of learning gains and student perceptions?

Existing pedagogies often fail to meet students' individual needs,
especially in classrooms where students have a wide range of prior
knowledge. Here, we have shown the advantage of using
**asynchronous AI tutoring as students' first substantial
engagement with challenging material**. AI could be used to
effectively teach introductory material to students before class,
which allows precious class time to be spent developing
higher-order skills such as advanced problem solving, project-based
learning, and group work. Instructors can assess these skills in
person, which avoids the problematic use of AI as a shortcut on
assessments such as homework, papers, and projects. As in a
**"flipped classroom"** approach, an AI tutor should not replace
in-person teaching—rather, it should be used to bring all students
up to a level where they can achieve the maximum benefit from
their time in class.

That said, beyond the initial introduction of material, AI tutors
like the ones employed here could serve an extremely wide range of
purposes, such as assisting with homework, offering study
guidance, and providing remedial lessons for underprepared
students. Yet our results show that, with today's GAI technology,
**pedagogical best practices must be explicitly and carefully
built into each such application**. As seen in previous studies
[2, 25], instructors should avoid using AI in situations where
students are likely to use it as a crutch to circumvent critical
thinking. We advise against the notion that AI, solely due to its
efficacy in enhancing teaching and learning, should entirely
supplant in-class instructional methods. Our demonstration
illustrates how AI can bolster student learning beyond the
confines of the classroom. We advocate harnessing this capability
to enable instructors to use in-class sessions for activities and
projects that foster advanced cognitive skills such as critical
thinking and content synthesis.

### Context, limitations, and future directions

Our AI tutoring approach was applied in a setting where students
were engaging substantially with material in particular subject
areas for the first time. Our lessons were comprised of activities
focused on learning objectives categorized at the **understanding,
applying, and analyzing levels of Bloom's Taxonomy** —as were the
associated pre- and post-test questions. This stage of learning,
characterized by a meaningful degree of information delivery,
appears to be particularly well suited for current generative AI
tutors.

The significant gains and positive affect observed in this study
may also depend on several factors: a heterogeneous student
population requiring varying instructional paces, integration of
high-quality instructional videos, a large language model capable
of closely following complex prompts (e.g., GPT-4), expert-crafted,
question-specific prompts written by instructors experienced with
the content, a carefully structured framework designed to scaffold
and guide student interactions, and content that lends itself to
such a format. While the advantages of the experimental condition
are widely generalizable and our findings have broad implications,
we do not presume that **structured AI tutoring will always
outperform in-class active learning in all contexts**, for
example, those requiring complex synthesis of multiple concepts
and higher-order critical thinking.

Compelling directions for future work include exploring other
contexts throughout the learning process where AI tutoring may be
successfully implemented, such as in homework, recitation, exam
studying, pre-class assignments, and laboratory. Valuable
follow-up studies could also explicitly examine the details of such
combinations throughout an entire course. This would also allow
for systematic integration of well-established
retention-enhancing strategies (e.g., spacing) and could provide
insights into other novel phenomena that may arise from prolonged
and varied use of AI in education, such as potential impact on
collaboration skills. Given that the current AI tutor
implementation mirrors well-established in-class active learning
pedagogies and generates comparable affect—with its primary
difference (besides personalization) being the medium of delivery,
which typically does not impact learning on its own [26]—it is
reasonable to expect findings from in-class active learning
approaches to carry over. Nonetheless, studies that explicitly
replicate known in-class active learning results [27, 28] would be
valuable for confirming and refining the details of this
transferability. Such research could include explorations of the
qualities that constitute effective system prompts and behaviors
for AI tutors in various situations (e.g., determining when the AI
tutor should openly provide answers versus guiding students to
reflect on their own responses).

Generative AI technology is developing very rapidly, allowing for
expansion of the capabilities and application of AI tutoring.
While accuracy of our AI tutor relied on pre-written answers, as
generative AI models improve in scientific reasoning, studies
could explore whether such efficacy could be achieved without a
provided solution. Also, in our approach, feedback was provided in
response to student input, but **multimodality** would allow AI
systems to interpret images (or audio) of a student's work and
more proactively provide feedback. Investigations could explore
whether holistic monitoring of a student's process could provide
feedback on issues with thinking that may not be addressed by
current pedagogies (in or out of the classroom) in which students
typically receive targeted feedback only when they ask a question.

## Conclusion

We have built an AI-based tutor, engineered with appropriate
prompts and scaffolding, that helps students learn significantly
more in less time and feel more engaged and motivated compared
with in-class active learning. This study confirms the feasibility
and effectiveness of AI tutors in educational settings, and
suggests design principles to guide future development of these
tools. As the prompts described here can be adapted to any subject
matter, **this approach can provide students, in a wide range of
disciplines, on-demand AI-powered support**.

These results and principles provide a blueprint for highly
effective AI-powered learning frameworks that are engaging and
suggest a pathway for widely accessible education on which
policymakers, technologists, and educators can collaborate. It
also serves as a foundation for a series of explorations of the
use of AI in educational settings.

## Methods

### Study population

The present study took place during the **Fall 2023 semester** in
Physical Sciences 2 (PS2), which is an introductory physics class
for the life sciences and is Harvard's largest physics class
(N = 233). Students were randomly assigned to two groups,
respecting the constraint that students who regularly worked
together in class during peer instruction were placed in the same
group in order to maximize the effectiveness of their in-class
learning. The demographics of the two groups were comparable (see
Table S2A), as were previous measures of their physics background
knowledge (see Table S2B). Note that FCI pretest scores are
comparable to those of students at other universities [29]. Of the
233 enrolled students, **194 were eligible for inclusion in the
study**. Eligibility was based on students' consent, participation
in both in-class and AI-tutored instruction, and completion of all
pre-tests and post-tests.

We note that the results hold for students with both lower and
higher performance abilities than typical students at various
institutions, as assessed by the widely recognized FCI test. They
also hold for all degrees of scientific attitudes—from non-expert
to expert—as gauged by the CLASS survey. Typical pre-instruction
FCI scores in educational institutions range from approximately
30% to 50% [30]. In this study, significant subpopulations span
this range. The subpopulations of students with pre-instruction
FCI scores below 40% and those above 40% both showed significantly
better post-test performance with AI tutoring compared to in-class
active learning (**p < 0.001**). This improvement was similarly
observed in students below and above the 65% benchmark [31] in
scientific attitudes on the CLASS.

### Course setting

The course (PS2) meets twice per week for 75 minutes each. The
study took place during one of the two meetings of the class
during the **ninth and tenth weeks** of the course. All in-class
lessons employed research-based best practices for in-class active
learning [32]. Each class involves a series of activities that
teach physics concepts and problem-solving skills. First the
instructor introduces an activity, then students work through the
activity in self-selected groups with support and guidance from
course staff, and finally the instructor provides targeted
feedback to address students' questions and difficulties.

This instructional approach has proved to be a successful
implementation of active learning, and has been shown to offer a
significant improvement over passive lectures [33]. We note that
the authors and instructors represented in the literature
demonstrating this in-class active learning approach to be
effective and superior to passive instruction overlap with those
of the present study. Similar active learning approaches have been
shown to increase learning across a wide range of STEM fields
[34]. Although active learning pedagogies may elicit negative
perceptions from students [35], both course instructors, as well
as their presentations in the course, achieved student evaluation
scores above the departmental and division averages. The active
learning pedagogy, optimized over the years to cater to the vast
majority of the student population, ensures minimal inactivity by
strategically allowing instructors to intervene and adjust the
class dynamically based on real-time observations of student
engagement and performance [32].

To verify the active learning emphasis of the class, students were
asked the following question at the end of the semester:
"Compared to the in-class time in other STEM classes you have
taken at Harvard, to what extent does the typical PS2 in-class
time use active learning strategies (i.e., provide the opportunity
to discuss and work on problems in class as opposed to passively
listening)." The overwhelming majority of students (**89%**)
indicated that PS2 used more active learning compared to other
STEM courses.

### Study design

The present study was approved by the Harvard University IRB
(study no. IRB23-0797) and followed a **crossover design**. The
design allowed for control of all aspects of the lessons that were
not of interest. The crossover design is summarized in Table S3.
For each of two lessons, each student:

1. took a **pre-class quiz** that established their baseline
   knowledge of the content for that lesson;
2. engaged in either the active classroom lesson (control
   condition) or the AI tutor lesson (experimental condition);
   and
3. took a **post-class quiz** as a test of learning.

The content and worksheet for the control and experimental
conditions were **identical**. The introductions for each activity
were also identical, varying only by the format of presentation:
live and in-person for the control group and over pre-recorded
video for the experimental group.

Given the crossover design, all students experienced both
conditions once during the study. The structure of the
experimental condition differed from the control condition in that
all interactions and feedback were with an AI tutor, rather than
with peer-instruction followed by instructor feedback. Students in
the experimental condition worked through the handout, asking
questions and confirming answers with the AI tutor, called **"PS2
Pal."** Students were given equal participation credit for both
conditions as well as for the associated pre- and post-test.
Students were told that their performance on the pre- and
post-tests would not impact their course grade in any way but were
told that in order to receive participation credit they needed to
demonstrate that they had made an honest effort in completing the
tests.

### Additional controls

In addition to using a crossover design we rigorously controlled
for potential bias and other unwanted influences. To prevent the
specific test questions from influencing the teaching or AI tutor
design, **the tests were constructed by a separate team member
from those involved in designing the AI or teaching the lessons**.
To prevent details of the lessons or AI prompts from influencing
the test of learning, the tests were written based on the learning
goals for the lesson and not the specific lesson content.

The lesson topics were chosen such that the result would be
optimally generalizable. These topics were independent of each
other, had little dependence on previous course content, and
required no special knowledge beyond high-school level
mathematics. The topics were also chosen to minimize the influence
of potential prior knowledge of the material—over 90% of the
students reported that they had not studied these topics in depth
before this course.

To ensure that the effect was independent of the particular
instructor, **the two lessons were taught by different
instructors** (i.e., each of the course's two co-instructors). We
note that the two instructors received student evaluations on
their teaching that exceeded the departmental and divisional means.

To make sure that the study design did not impact the
effectiveness of in-person instruction during the experiment,
students in class learned from the same instructors, with the same
student:staff ratio, and in the same peer-instruction groups as
they had throughout the course. As mentioned above, keeping
students with their peer-instruction groups meant that subjects
were randomized at the level of these groups (**2–3 students**)
rather than as individuals. An alternate linear regression model
that clusters at the group level (instead of at the level of
individual students) has similarly robust results for AI versus
in-class instruction (p < 0.001) and negligible changes to the
point estimates for the effects of each covariate. With this
clustered model, however, it is difficult to interpret factors
such as time on task, which varies widely at the individual level
under the AI-tutored conditions.

While the time commitment for preparation of a single AI-supported
lesson was very manageable, there was significant overhead.
Preparing system prompts for questions and solutions for a
particular lesson was done over a few days. Since activities and
solutions were already written for the in-class lesson, this time
was spent converting the format of the content to a format
appropriate for the AI platform as well as engaging in test
conversations for each question and iterating. **The most
significant time commitment involved in preparing the
AI-supported lessons was the development of an AI tutor platform
software that took pedagogical best practices into consideration**
(e.g., structured around individual questions embedded in
individual assignments), which took several months.

  expected to be greater than those represented by metrics
  presented here due to a ceiling effect in the post-test scores
  (resulting from the unexpected effectiveness of the AI tutor).
  Note that measures that are less sensitive to ceiling effect,
  such as the median, will be more reliable than measures that are
  more sensitive to ceiling effect, such as straight gain or
  mean.
- While the data is combined, the trend for each week's tests was
  as observed in Figure 1, namely post-test scores for the AI
  group were greater than the in-class active learning group's
  scores.
- **Bloom's Taxonomy** is a hierarchical model used to classify
  educational learning objectives into levels of complexity and
  specificity. The original taxonomy was revised in 2001 and is
  as follows: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing,
  evaluating, and creating. (Anderson, L. W. & Krathwohl, D. R.
  *A Taxonomy for Learning, Teaching, and Assessing*, Longman,
  2001.) Lessons were 33% analyzing, 41% applying, 21%
  understanding, and 4% remembering.
- Videos were produced at the Harvard University Derek Bok Center
  production studio, and the instructor (GK) has a decade of
  experience hosting, writing, and producing videos and
  documentaries (e.g., via NOVA | PBS).
- Equivalent growth mindset and enjoyment, increased engagement
  and motivation, and improved satisfaction with feedback.
- Currently, the models with the most advanced scientific
  reasoning capabilities have longer response times; in the
  context of AI tutoring, the model choice should take into
  account efficiency as well as reasoning capabilities.
