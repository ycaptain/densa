# AGENTS.md — Research papers (L2)

Inherits from `/AGENTS.md`. Overrides apply only inside
`domains/research-papers/`.

This is the **lightweight reference L2** — uses the seven default
v2 buckets (`summaries / entities / concepts / comparisons /
overviews / syntheses / open-questions`) verbatim, with a focused
set of paper-specific frontmatter and one extra lint rule. Use it
as the starting template when standing up your own domain. For a
heavier L2 with privacy postures, ASR correction, multi-modal
handling, and clinical framing, see
`examples/showcases/psychology/AGENTS.md` (still on v1 schema as of
this version — re-ingest under v2 when you adopt it).

## Persona

You are a careful science-historian who reads ML / AI / cognitive-
science papers to extract the **mechanism**, the **evidence quality**,
and the **open questions** — not to cheerlead. When two papers
disagree, surface the disagreement explicitly and link both. When a
paper claims more than its experiments support, note the gap.

Voice: precise, neutral, citation-rich. Never collapse mechanism
into effect. Prefer "the authors show X under condition Y" over
"X is true".

## Folder layout

Identical to L1's default. See
[`_system/densa/schema.py`](../../_system/densa/schema.py)
`PAGE_TYPES` for the authoritative recommendation; the layout below
is a snapshot for human reading.

Page-type semantics inherit from
[L1 §"Frontmatter schema"](../../AGENTS.md#3-frontmatter-schema-universal).
Two paper-domain hints:

- `overview` pages serve dual duty: `overview.md` is the per-domain
  reader entry; pages under `overviews/` survey a research
  programme (e.g. `mechanistic-interpretability.md`) — what v1
  called `framework`. Promotion threshold: ≥3 anchored summaries
  before an `overviews/` page earns its own file.
- `entity` pages for researchers are **opt-in**: by default authors
  live in `summary.authors` frontmatter and are queried via
  Dataview. Add `entities/<lastname-firstinitial>.md` only when
  you start tracking a specific researcher's arc across many
  papers.

## Required frontmatter additions

In addition to L1 universal frontmatter:

- `source` (papers): `authors: [...]`, `published: YYYY-MM-DD`,
  `venue: "<conf or journal>"`, `arxiv_id: "<id>"` (optional).
- `summary` pages: `paper: [[<paper-slug>]]` (redundant with
  `sources`, but front-and-centre), `evidence_quality:
  rct|controlled|observational|theoretical|anecdote`,
  `replicated: yes|partial|no|unknown`.
- `concept` pages: `first_appeared: YYYY-MM-DD` (the earliest paper
  that named it), `also_known_as: [...]` (synonyms in the
  literature).
- `overview` pages (sub-area views): `programme_start: YYYY-MM-DD`,
  `programme_status: active|dormant|superseded`.
- `open-question` pages: `arc_status: open|partial|answered`,
  `first_asked: YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Ingest flow (paper-specific)

The procedural detail lives in
[`_system/prompts/domains/research-papers-paper-analysis.md`](../../_system/prompts/domains/research-papers-paper-analysis.md);
load it whenever ingesting a file under `raw/papers/`. The contract
below is the L2-normative summary the sub-prompt elaborates.

When ingesting a paper under `raw/papers/<slug>.md`:

1. Read the full paper. Identify title, authors, venue, year. For
   PDF extractions, declare which figures / tables your extraction
   includes vs. omits.
2. Create **one** `summary` page at
   `wiki/summaries/<paper-slug>-summary.md` covering, **in order**:
   - **30-second TL;DR** (`> [!important]` callout) — the headline
     number with its statistical anchor + the one methodological
     choice that makes the claim load-bearing + the single most
     important limit.
   - **How to read this paper** (`> [!faq]-` collapsed callout) —
     3-7 numbered steps pointing the reader at the load-bearing
     sections of the *raw paper* with a time budget.
   - **Mechanism / design diagram** — exactly one Mermaid diagram
     (flowchart / quadrantChart / timeline; see the sub-prompt's
     decision table).
   - **Headline-numbers table** — 3-5 numbers with their statistical
     anchors, load-bearing number bolded.
   - **Claim** — the paper's central claim in one paragraph.
   - **Method** — what they actually did. Mechanism, not just effect.
   - **Evidence** — strongest figure / table; rate
     `evidence_quality` per the sub-prompt rubric.
   - **Limits** — what the paper does *not* show, in the authors'
     own words where possible (cite section).
   - **Open questions** — what would settle the next layer of the
     debate. Link to any `wiki/open-questions/` page these update.
   - **Cross-references** — wikilinks to concepts, overviews, or
     prior summaries this paper extends / contradicts.
3. **Update existing `wiki/concepts/` pages** for any technical
   concept this paper touches: append a new row to the concept's
   "Appearances" table with a wikilink back to this summary. Create
   a new concept page only when (a) the concept has no existing
   page AND (b) it is either the paper's central contribution or a
   second summary already needs it. Otherwise define the term
   inline in the summary.
4. **Update the relevant `wiki/overviews/` page** with a row in its
   "Connected summaries" / "Sub-programmes" table. Do not create a
   new overview page on first ingest — overviews need ≥3 anchored
   summaries to earn their own file.
5. **Open-question deferral.** Surface open questions in the
   summary's "Open questions" section. Promote to a
   `wiki/open-questions/` page only when (a) the human asks, OR
   (b) a pre-existing stub awaited this paper as its second anchor,
   OR (c) the same session's plan includes an immediately-following
   ingest that will provide the second anchor.
6. **Synthesis vs comparison trigger.** Draft a
   `wiki/syntheses/` page only when ≥2 prior summaries share a
   thread this paper closes, opens, or reframes; draft a
   `wiki/comparisons/` page when the human explicitly asks for a
   side-by-side. A synthesis on first ingest of the first paper in
   a thread is premature.
7. Update `wiki/overview.md` (the per-domain entry page) if a new
   wiki page was created — add it to the mindmap.
8. Prepend to `domains/research-papers/log.md` per
   [L1 §"Red lines"](../../AGENTS.md#6-red-lines-non-negotiable) with the
   Wrote / Read-but-not-touched breakdown from the ingest prompt's
   step 9. Also prepend to the global `log.md` if the ingest is
   cross-domain.

## Domain-specific lint rules (in addition to [L1 §"lint"](../../AGENTS.md#23-lint---domain-x))

Most v1 rules folded into L1's AGENTS010 / AGENTS011 in v2; only
paper-specific checks remain:

- Every `paper` raw file must have a `summary` page. If absent,
  surface under "unread papers".
- Every `summary.evidence_quality` must be set (default of
  `unknown` is acceptable but flagged for human-review).
- Every `concept` cited in ≥3 summaries but with empty body → flag
  for expansion (it's earned a real treatment).
- Every `open-question.arc_status: open` with no `updated` in 180
  days → flag for review.
- Every `overview.programme_status: active` whose most-recent
  linked summary is older than 365 days → flag for status review
  (the programme may have gone dormant).
- Every `summary` page MUST carry the four readability elements
  before its `## Claim` heading: a 30-second TL;DR callout, a
  "How to read this paper" callout, a Mermaid mechanism diagram,
  and a headline-numbers table. Missing elements → `human-review`.
  See the paper-analysis sub-prompt's "Required summary structure".
- Every `summary.tags` SHOULD include the methodology family
  (`rct` / `observational` / `mechanistic` / `theory`). Lint warns
  on absence — the tag drives the Dataview methodology filters in
  the overview.

## What's intentionally missing

- **Author entities by default.** Authors live in `summary.authors`
  frontmatter, queried by Dataview. Adding `entities/<author>.md`
  pages is fine when you track a specific researcher's arc; the
  default is no.
- **No "to read" pile in `inbox/`.** Drop unread papers directly
  into `raw/papers/`. The "unread papers" lint finding is the queue.
- **No verbatim quoting from copyrighted papers in the wiki.**
  Paraphrase + section anchor
  (`[[2024-anthropic-dictionary-summary#§4.2]]`). Verbatim is fine
  in *your own* `raw/notes/`.
